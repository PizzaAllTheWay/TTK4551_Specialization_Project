\section{State Estimation}

intro to it
Bayes filter
KF + Talk about propagation Newton and also RK4 method :)
EKF
ESKF
UKF (WIth bias and all :) f() IMU model for that) + Alternative Sigma Point generation for better aproximation and stability
Some other that might be uselful for later just to mention, like ESKF or UKF for system Idtentification for hydrostatic and parameters and better model aproximation.
TUNING (NIS and other stuff to keep in mind)
