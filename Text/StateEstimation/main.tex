\section{State Estimation}

intro to it
Bayes filter
KF
EKF
UKF + Alternative Sigma Point generation for better aproximation and stability
Some other that might be uselful for later just to mention, like ESKF or UKF for system Idtentification for hydrostatic and parameters and better model aproximation.
