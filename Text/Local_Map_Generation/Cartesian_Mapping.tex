\subsection{Cartesian Mapping}
After swath processing, the sonar data is projected into Cartesian coordinates to form a spatially consistent 2D map of the seafloor. Each pixel is mapped from sonar beam geometry using the current vehicle state estimate and beam angles derived from the transducer geometry.  
\\ \\
This step uses the measurement model $h(\mathbf{x})$ to transform each intensity bin from polar coordinates (range, angle) into global $(x,y)$ coordinates. The resulting grid represents local backscatter intensity and is used as the input for feature extraction and mapping. Bilinear interpolation and nearest-neighbor filling are used to address undersampling and maintain uniform grid resolution. The generated map is then timestamped and stored as a local map frame for integration into the SLAM pipeline.

write about 1/3 rd or old local map being reused and 2/3rds are new map, and that thsi if for blablabla, explain in detail
