\subsection{Feature Extraction}
In this stage, distinctive features are identified from the local Cartesian map to serve as landmarks for data association in SLAM. Feature extraction operates on the intensity map, detecting spatially stable structures such as edges, shadows, or texture gradients.  
\\ \\
Common methods include local contrast enhancement, gradient-based edge detection, and blob or corner identification from intensity variation. Candidate landmarks are filtered by geometric constraints and consistency checks to ensure that only stable, persistent features are passed to the SLAM frontend.  
\\ \\
Each extracted landmark is stored with its local position, confidence score, and descriptor, forming a compact representation of the local environment. These features are used for association with subsequent maps to maintain global consistency and reduce drift during trajectory estimation.
\\ \\
Should also mantion that 1/3 of old map is reused and 2/3rds are new map from the catersian mapping here, already explained in catersian mapping in detail so just refrence to not forget it lol
\\ \\
Feature extraction algorithm to know: SIFT! BUT Its to many false positives and negatives acording to Vegard paper so then use their cusom method.
Mention the HUgen paper that has:
Features of ineterst are (corners, blobs, texture-rich areas) that are:
- invariant to scale (works even if the same object appears larger/smaller),
- Invariant to rotation (works regardless of camera/vehicle angle),
- Partially invariant to illumination (robust to brightness and contrast changes — important for sonar)

Aditional chapter we must write is to add Descriptors to feature eaxtraction, when extracting features we also add featuers ecause when doing feature mathing it is very cheap and fast way to do it jesjes. Basically in eac feature encode some aditional description. Baiscally a simple way that is effective to mathc diffreent features afterwards in an effective way jesjes. Have a dicssripition making chapter so that if can be used later in FLANN Mattching algorithm or something. SO have them Descriptors generated like that. They dont do that in the Matsers before because tehy did glovbal Data Asocaiteion with is expensive on each run, will be described later, but descriptors do help with this yesyes.
