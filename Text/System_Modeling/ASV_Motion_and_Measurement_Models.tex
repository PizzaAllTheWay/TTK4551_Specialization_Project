\subsection{ASV Motion and Measurement Models}
Fossenâ€™s 6-DOF marine craft model (as one formulation).

INS-based kinematic model (as your chosen implementation).

GNSS (as the aiding/measurement model, 2 antenas can get position and Heading).

And the comparison/discussion between Fossen vs. INS (why INS chosen).
Basically select good tool for the job you want to do, even though Fossen model is great, for our use case in SLAM a INS model will suffice, especially i combination with aiding measurements. Fossens is good but INS is simpler and in SLAM case for building a local map for Data Processing step it is more than god enough. like yes in this case Fossne might be more accurate if we had more system parameters that we know but then we would have to estimate system parameters, and for that we need system identification at that point. And then we have to consider is it worth doing full system identification for 1\% maybe more performance? SO jesjes INS model it is because of it.
