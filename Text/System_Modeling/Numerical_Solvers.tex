\subsection{Numerical Solvers}
Expricit and Impricit solvers, focus only on explicit solvers as tehy are real-time, while implicit is forstable  simulations only. Explicit is good enough for navigation use case

X.Y.1 Newton–Raphson Method

For solving nonlinear equations (used in implicit models or iterative equilibrium solving).

Brief explanation: derivative-based root finding, convergence properties.

Example: solving steady-state forces or trim conditions in ASV model.

X.Y.2 Runge–Kutta Integration (RK4)

For numerical time integration of dynamic equations (e.g., Fossen’s 6-DOF model).

Derivation of RK4 update rule.

Discussion on trade-offs: stability vs. accuracy vs. computational cost.

Possibly mention comparison with Euler or semi-implicit schemes.
