\subsection{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Explain the role of data association (DA) in SLAM: linking new landmark measurements to existing map landmarks or creating new ones.
    \item Emphasize assumption of static or near-static environments, since dynamic-object DA remains an active research problem.
    \item Underwater environments change slowly; seabed structure is mostly stationary → DA complexity is manageable.
    \item Mention that DA output feeds the factor graph: every validated association produces measurement factors.
    \item State that DA failures lead to catastrophic SLAM drift, thus robust gating + multi-stage consistency checks are required.
    \item Mention that this field is a hot topic today and as of today no all size fits all solution exist for this problem, thus carefull cosnidertion and trial and error jesjes
\end{itemize}
