\subsection{Nearest Neighbor}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Describe selecting the nearest candidate inside the gate by Mahalanobis distance.
    \item Very fast and simple but brittle under clutter or false positives.
    \item Works only because seabed landmarks are sparse and mostly static.
\end{itemize}
