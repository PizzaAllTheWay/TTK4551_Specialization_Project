\subsection{Mixture Models}
Very short 1 page max
\begin{itemize}
    \item Explain idea: instead of discrete DA, introduce mixture factors into the graph (multiple hypotheses).
    \item GTSAM supports mixture factors → optimizer resolves ambiguity automatically.
    \item Theoretically best solution for ambiguous DA.
    \item However, MMSAM and mixture smoothing methods are not real-time capable for SSS frame-rate.
    \item Conclude: great conceptually, but not feasible for deployment here.
\end{itemize}
