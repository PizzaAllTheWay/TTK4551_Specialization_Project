Gating (Mahalanobis)

matching/tracking

Also talk about loop closures

produce measurement factors for optimizer

DA - JCBB <3<3<3 or RANSAC <3 or probabalistic techniques (eghhhh questionable)
probabalistic techniques:
  - posterior probability hypothesis (very expensive) 
  - Variations of JPDA (questionable validity)
  - Particle filter (FastSLAM) (it kind of works, implentation issues and has its own isdues that in practice have shown to be not a suitable solution for SLAM)

This JCBB and RANSAC perfect for stationary objects, but if moving objects it hard, this type of hybrid DA methods still under reaserch... luckily underwater arent manny moving large objects, most are stationary and thus this problem can be avoided for the most part.... some caveats jesjes
