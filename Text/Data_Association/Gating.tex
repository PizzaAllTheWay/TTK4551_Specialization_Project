\subsection{Gating}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Define gating as the first stage of DA to prune incompatible landmark candidates.
    \item Use Mahalanobis distance:
    \[
    \|x - \mu\|_{P} = \sqrt{(x-\mu)^{T} P^{-1} (x-\mu)}
    \]
    \item Explain that this produces elliptical gates based on predicted uncertainty. Imprortnat to note eleptical vs normal one and a picture on difference (Euclidean vs Mahalanobis)
    \item Important for both local and global DA; avoids combinatorial explosion before JCBB.
\end{itemize}

IMPORTANT NOTE: Remember to delete Gating from iSAM and just refrence it to here and the picture instead!
