\subsection{JCBB}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Joint Compatibility Branch and Bound: tests multi-landmark hypotheses jointly.
    \item Uses gating + compatibility checks across all combinations.
    \item Branch-and-bound pruning makes it feasible in real-time for small to medium local maps.
    \item Ideal for static environments like seabed; core algorithm used for DA here.
\end{itemize}
