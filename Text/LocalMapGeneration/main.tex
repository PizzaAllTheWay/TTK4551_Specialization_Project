\section{Local Map Generation}

All use State estimates and measuremnt model h() here

Also when generating map locally we build it from sonar 1D images to a 2D recontruction, this takes time and this image is what is then processed and fed into SLAM
In adition next step we take with the last 1/3rd or the old image and generate a new image that is 2/3 new, this then becomes new 3/3 image that gets fed into SLAM and so forth
This is done so that data asocaition we dont cut off crucial info between frames and Data Sdociation and landmark detection can extract features again here.
