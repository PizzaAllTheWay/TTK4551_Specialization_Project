\section{Global Map And Trajectory}
A very short chapter on how the global map is generated and the trajectory is tracked. Very simple concepts form Computer Graphics and Data Algorithms. Basic stuff. No need to spend a lot of time here. Maybe Data Base for storing and accesing global map super fast for analyzing, maybe...???
