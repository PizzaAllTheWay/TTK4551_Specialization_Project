\section{Global Map And Trajectory}
A very short chapter on how the global map is generated and the trajectory is tracked. Very simple concepts form Computer Graphics and Data Algorithms. Basic stuff. No need to spend a lot of time here. Maybe Data Base for storing and accesing global map super fast for analyzing, maybe...???
kNN based KD-Tree many local Cartesian maps we get jesjes, need to sew them together maybe do some smoothing on overlaping cells??? otherwise very simple chapter
Also talk about 1/3rd and 2/3rds or map being geerated old and new and that also means need smooting over when overlaying local maps into global map scene. Talk about that we shoudl look at the Picture in Local Map Generatioon the 1/3rd 2/3rd to get undertanding of the problem jesjes
