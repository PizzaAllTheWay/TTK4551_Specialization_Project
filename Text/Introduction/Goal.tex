\subsection{Goal}
The goal of this specialization project is to study, design, and outline a practical side scan sonar SLAM (SSS SLAM) architecture that can operate in real time on constrained embedded hardware. The work focuses on creating a clear and lightweight SSS SLAM pipeline that achieves consistent real-time performance on recorded coastal datasets while remaining suitable for deployment on autonomous surface vessels.
\\ \\
A second goal is to implement this pipeline on the microAmpere ASV and evaluate its performance both on recorded data and in real coastal environments. This includes porting the system to the vessels onboard hardware, integrating it into the perception stack, and validating that the SLAM framework can maintain real-time operation during field trials. Together, these goals shift the work from offline analysis toward a deployable, field ready SSS SLAM module for autonomous surface vessel navigation.
