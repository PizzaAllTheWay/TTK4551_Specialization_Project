\subsection{UN Sustainability Goals}
This project directly supports several UN Sustainability Goals related to ocean safety, resilient infrastructure, and responsible use of maritime environments. Autonomous coastal vessels capable of accurate self localization and seabed mapping contribute to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{SDG 9 -- Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure:} Developing advanced robotic systems that improve maritime safety, reduce operational risk, and support next generation autonomous transport.
    \item \textbf{SDG 13 -- Climate Action:} Enabling efficient autonomous monitoring of coastal environments, reducing emissions from manned patrol vessels, and supporting long duration data collection with minimal energy consumption.
    \item \textbf{SDG 14 -- Life Below Water:} Providing high quality seabed data that can support environmental monitoring, habitat protection, and sustainable marine operations, especially in sensitive or shallow coastal areas.
\end{itemize}
By enabling autonomous vessels to operate safely and efficiently in coastal waters, the system developed in this thesis contributes to safer marine navigation, reduced environmental impact, and increased accessibility of marine robotics for ecological monitoring and research.
