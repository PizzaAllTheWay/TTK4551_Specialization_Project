\subsection{Goal}
This specialization project studies how marine robots navigate on their own, with a focus on \gls{SLAM}. The aim is to build a solid, practical understanding of modern navigation and \gls{SLAM} algorithms, how current \gls{SLAM} systems are structured, and which methods are used in practice. The work centers on sonar-based \gls{SLAM}, in particular Side Scan Sonar (SSS) \gls{SLAM} for \gls{AUV}s, because side scan sonar is widely available on mature platforms and is useful for mapping large seabed areas. I will work with real \gls{AUV} datasets (for eks from NTNUs \gls{AUR Lab} platforms such as \gls{LAUV} Harald) to evaluate how well \gls{SSS SLAM} supports navigation tasks, and to see what it takes to run the pipeline close to real time. The project builds on prior work, including the 2023 master thesis by Vegard Haraldstad on a sidescan sonar pipeline \cite{side_scan_sonar_master_thesis} and the 2024 Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) paper on side scan sonar based landmark detection for underwater vehicles \cite{side_scan_sonar_paper}. The plan is to study these methods, reimplement the key parts, adapt them where needed and make \gls{SSS SLAM} run in real time on real hardware.
