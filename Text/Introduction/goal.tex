\subsection{Goal}
This specialization project investigates navigation and SLAM for marine robots with a focus on sidescan sonar (SSS) SLAM. The objective is to study and reimplement the core elements of modern SSS SLAM pipelines and demonstrate online/real-time performance on real AUV datasets (for example from NTNU's AUR Lab platforms such as LAUV Harald). The work builds on the 2023 master thesis by Haraldstad \cite{side_scan_sonar_master_thesis} and on recent methods for SSS landmark detection \cite{side_scan_sonar_paper}. The scope is to implement and optimize the core pipeline components needed for real-time operation, benchmark them on the same dataset used in the prior thesis, and show that end-to-end latency meets or exceeds the sensor rate while preserving mapping quality.
\\ \\
A second phase of the project focuses on embedded deployment on a autonomous surface vessel (ASV). The goal is to port and integrate the validated core pipeline on ship borne hardware, assess sidescan sonar performance in coastal waters, and shift the work from algorithm design to practical system integration. This phase will use NTNU's MicroAmpere ASV.
